# Configuration file for the Barnes-Hut tree Poisson solver contributed by Richard Wunsch

# This solver requires (some version of) Paramesh
REQUIRES Grid/GridMain/paramesh

# Set up a name to use if ifdef/ifndef within the fortran code.
#  Note this name cannot be used in Config files, only .F90.

# Parameters:
D gr_bhPhysMACTW      - if true, physical MACs are used for calculation during
D & tree walk
D gr_bhPhysMACComm    - if true, physical MACs are used for calculation during
D & communication of block trees
D gr_bhTreeLimAngle   - limit opening angle (if only geometric MAC is used)
D gr_bhTreeSafeBox    - relative (w.r.t. to the block size) size of a cube
D & around each block in which the target cell cannot be located in tree walk
D & during interaction of the target cell with this block
D gr_bhUseUnifiedTW   - if true, the unified tree walk (Barnes-Hut type) is
D & used; otherwise, MAC for long distance interaction (with non-leaf block) is
D & evaluated only once for all cells in the block
D gr_bhTWMaxQueueSize - maximum number of elements in the priority queue

# distribution among processors to achieve reasonable load balancing;
# these features are highly experimental and it is not recommended to switch
# them on in this version; also, the block appropriate work load has to be
