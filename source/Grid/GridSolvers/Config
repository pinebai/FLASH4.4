# NOTE: The ordering here may need to be changed, when several GridSolver implementations
#       are configured in and are supposed to cooperate.  In general, the last directory
#       here "wins" when setup decides which instance of a source file, like Grid_solvePoisson.F90,
#       to link into the object directory. And listed dirctories win over those not mentioned.
#       There are multiple implementations in particular of Grid_solvePoisson.F90, and the
#       miot important consideration here is usually to pick the right one of those.
#       Examples:
#       1) To use PFFT for some non-Poisson-solving purpose, combined with BHTree for self-gravity,
#       BHTree should appear in the list AFTER Pfft:
#            CHILDORDER ... Pfft ... BHTree ...          
#       2) To use HYPRE for some non-Poisson-solving purpose (as usually for duffusion), combined with
#       Multigrid for self-gravity, Multigrid should appear in the list AFTER HYPRE:
#            CHILDORDER ... HYPRE ... Multigrid ...          

# Multigrid after Pfft so that we use Multigrid version of Grid_solvePoisson when we run with PFFT extensions.
# BiPCGStab after Multigrid, MultigridMC, HYPRE to use the version of Grid_solvePoisson from BiPCGStab.
# DEV: HYPRE should likely come earlier by default.
