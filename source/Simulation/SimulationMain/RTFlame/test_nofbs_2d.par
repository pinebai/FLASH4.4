#FIXEDBLOCKSIZE mode ::
# When using fixed blocksize, iGridSize etc are redundant in
# runtime parameters. These quantities are calculated as 
# iGridSize = NXB*iprocs
# jGridSize = NYB*jprocs
# kGridSize = NZB*kprocs
#NONFIXEDBLOCKSIZE mode ::
# iGridSize etc must be specified. They constitute the global
# number of grid points in the physical domain without taking 
# the guard cell into account. The local blocksize is calculated
# as iGridSize/iprocs  etc.
