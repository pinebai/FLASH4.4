Rayleigh-Taylor Flame setup

author:  Dean Townsley


Setup for simulating the propagation of Rayleigh-Taylor unstable
flames.  This setup will work in 1,2 or 3 dimensions with little
modification.

Initially a layer of fuel is setup above a layer of hot, burned ash
all in hydrostatic equilibrium.  (Note that "up" here is the +x
direction) This is much like a standard R-T problem.  The lower
boundary is reflecting and the upper is (diode) outflow.  A
perturbation is placed on the interface between the dense overlying
layers and the less dense underneath.

As the simulation commences, the flame interface will propagate upward
into the unburned material while R-T perturbs the interface.  The
intention of the setup is to study the interplay between these two
processes.

Both the fuel and ash are setup as isothermal hydrostatically stable
layers.  The reference density and temperature is used to set these
values just above the initial position of the flame interface.
