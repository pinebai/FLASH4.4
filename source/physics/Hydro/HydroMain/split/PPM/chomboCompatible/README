Experiments with Sod simulation and different Hydro modes.  Key
parameters in chomboLike.par for all experiments are
  eintSwitch     = 0.0
  hy_fluxRepresentation = "hybrid"

(All explanations assume a 1D simulation with blocks consisting of 8
internal cells and 4 guard cells.)


Standard Sod
------------

All non-boundary internal cells are updated by Hydro (i.e. cells 6 to
11).  FLASH calls Paramesh to obtain the conserved fluxes for coarse
blocks.  Hydro uses the fluxes to update boundary internal cells
(i.e. cells 5 and cells 12).

./setup Sod -auto +pm4dev -parfile=chomboLike.par


Experimental Sod (Chombo-compatible Hydro)
------------------------------------------

All internal cells are updated by Hydro (i.e. cells 5 to 12).  FLASH
calls PARAMESH to obtain the conserved flux correction for coarse
blocks.  Hydro uses the flux correction to correct boundary internal
cells (i.e. cells 5 and 12).

./setup Sod -auto chomboCompatibleHydro=True +pm4dev -parfile=chomboLike.par

1). Use the following parameters for the standard FLASH update solution
  chomboLikeUpdateSoln = .false.
  excludeGradPresFromFlux = .true.

Magnitude difference in density between this and standard Sod using
8-procs: 1.577e-13

2). Use the following parameters for the Chombo-like update solution
  chomboLikeUpdateSoln = .true.
  excludeGradPresFromFlux = .false.

Magnitude difference in density between this and standard Sod using
8-procs: 2.287e-13
