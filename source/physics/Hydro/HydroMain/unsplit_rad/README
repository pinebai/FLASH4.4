This directory contains a variant of the "unsplit" Hydro solver.

This variant implements additional terms in the FLD Rad-Hydro equations to
handle streaming and transition-to-streaming regimes better (including
in particular effects of radiation pressure) than the regular version
of unsplit Hydro used for HEDP simulations and similar applications.

We call this RADFLAH - Radiation Flux-Limiter Aware Hydro.
Setup with shortcut +uhd3tR instead of +uhd3t .
This has had limited testing, mostly in 1D spherical geometry.

The current implementation assumes that the fluid is described by two
temperatures (matter+radiation), and thus the "electron" componenent
really represents "matter"; we hope to remove reliance on this
assumption in the future. With this assumption in place, this code has
to be used together with a "MatRad3" implementation of multiTemp Eos -
see also physics/Eos/Eos/EosMain/multiTemp/MatRad3/README.

The current implementation assumes there is only one radiation group
(grey opacities). Again, we hope to remedy this in the future.

Currently there is no equivalent variant for MHD - this should be
straightforward to implement, and we plan to provide this in the
future (probably under MHD_StaggeredMesh in this directory).
