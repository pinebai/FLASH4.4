#The FLASH UG is very primitive in that it does not know the corner
#block neighbors (which my algorithm needs).  In future we need to
#replace the FLASH UG, which only maintains left and right neighbors
#in each of the NDIM directions, with an NDIM cartesian communicator.
#Once we have a cartesian communicator it is trivial to find the
#corner neighbors.
