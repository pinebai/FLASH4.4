PARAMETER hx_dtFactor REAL 0.5 [0.0+ ... ]

D hx_ieTimeCoef Constant coefficient for scaling ion/ele coupling time
PARAMETER hx_ieTimeCoef REAL 1.0 [0.0 ...]

D hx_relTol relative tolerance for temperature errors introduced by HeatExchange.
D & This runtime parameter affects the time step computed by Heatexchange_computeDt.
D & Basically, if the max (abs) temperature adjustment that would be introduced in any nonzero
D & component in any cell is less than hx_relTol, then the time step limit is relaxed.
D & Set to a negative value to inherite the value of runtime parameter eos_tolerance.
PARAMETER hx_relTol	REAL 	-1.0
