This subtree contains "MatRad3" variants of several of the multiTemp
Eos implementations. Normally in FLASH, "multiTemp" means 3T, with
temperatures / energies / pressures stored in three separate
components; with "MatRad3", the various arrays are still sized for
three components, but the meaning is different: EOS_TEMPELE and
EOS_TEMPRAD components are used to store matter and radiation
components, respectively, while EOS_TEMPION is mostly ignored (and
should be set to 0).  Same for energies (EOS_EINTELE and EOS_EINTRAD
are used), pressures (EOS_PRESELE and EOS_PRESRAD are used); Same for
UNK variables: TELE_VAR, EELE_VAR, PELE_VAR represent the "matter",
not just electrons.

These Eos implementations are expected to be used together with
a RADFLAH implementation of Hydro, in particular
  physics/Hydro/HydroMain/unsplit_rad/Hydro_Unsplit .

Currently available:

 * Gamma
 * Multigamma
 * Hemmholtz/SpeciesBased (experimental)
