# For debugging - some Eos routines put diagnostic info into these
# variables if they are defined.
D trte_variable Eos_putData saves ratio of radiation temperature to electron temperature here.
D prpe_variable Eos_putData saves ratio of radiation pressure to electron pressure here.
VARIABLE TRTE  # Temp. radiations / temp. electrons
VARIABLE PRPE  # Pres. radiations / pres. electrons
