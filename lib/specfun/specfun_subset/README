 ====== readme for specfun ======

 SPECFUN 2.5 is a collection of transportable Fortran programs for
 special functions and accompanying test programs similar in
 concept to those in ELEFUNT.  Both single- and double-precision
 versions can be extracted from the supplied source code with simple
 editing changes.  NOTE: at least one version MUST be extracted
 before the source will compile.
