    hy_fluxRepresentation [STRING] ["fluxes"]
        Valid Values: "hybrid", "fluxes", "auto"
        determines the nature of the data stored in flux arrays. With this
        parameter set to "fluxes", the fluxes and cell volumes used in the Hydro
        method are calculated correctly using geometry measures (in units
        matching those in which coordinates are represented). If
        hy_fluxRepresentation is "hybrid", fluxes are calculated in a simpler
        way; for example, the fluxes in Cartesian coordinates use the convention
        Face Area == 1 (and thus Cell Volume == dx during the X sweep, etc.).
        Both settings lead to a correct algorithm, because what is ultimately
        applied in the Hydro update is of the form fluxes times dt/CellVolume,
        so cell areas (thus fluxes) and volumes can be multiplied by an
        arbitrary constant (as long as it is done consistently) without changing
        results (except for rounding effects). The setting here must match
        Paramesh's understanding of what the "fluxes" are that it is being
        passed if Grid_conserveFluxes is called: If hy_fluxRepresentation is
        "fluxes", then Paramesh4 should have set consv_fluxes==.true., 
        consv_flux_densities==.false. If hy_fluxRepresentation is "hybrid", then
        Paramesh4 should have set consv_fluxes==.false.,
        consv_flux_densities==.true. Hydro_init will try to set Paramesh to the
        right mode if possible, this requires Paramesh to be compiled in LIBRARY
        mode. If this fails, the flux representation will be modified to
        correspond to what the Grid unit supports. A third possible value for
        hy_fluxRepresentation is "auto", in which case the Hydro code unit will
        pick either "fluxes" or "hybrid" based on geometry and support in Grid.
